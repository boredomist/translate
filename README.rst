About
_____

This project is part of Google Summer of Code 2013, working with the `Sugar Labs
<http://sugarlabs.org>`_ project.

This README will become more useful over time, but for now, a more complete
overview of the goals that I intend to accomplish with this project can be found
`on the Sugar Labs wiki
<http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Summer_of_Code/Translation_Server>`_.

In brief, this project aims to create a server application that provides a
convenient interface to many machine translation backends, automatically, as
well as a Python API to utilize this server.

And yes, the actual name is pending.
