About
_____

This project is part of Google Summer of Code 2013, working with the `Sugar Labs <http://sugarlabs.org>`_ project. 

This README will become more useful over time, but for now, a more complete overview of the goals that I intend to accomplish with this project can be found `on the Sugar Labs wiki <http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Summer_of_Code/Translation_Server>`_.

In brief, this project aims to create a server application that provides a convenient interface to many machine translation backends, automatically, as well as a Python API to utilize this server.

And yes, the actual name is pending.
